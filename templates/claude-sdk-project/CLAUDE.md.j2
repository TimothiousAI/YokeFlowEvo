## Project Overview

## How to Work on This Project

When implementing features or fixing bugs, follow this structured workflow:

### 1. Consult Domain Expertise First

Before writing code, read the relevant expertise files:
```
.claude/commands/experts/{domain}/expertise.yaml
```

Available domains: {{ domains | join(', ') }}

### 2. Use Commands for Structured Work

- `/plan <feature>` → Generate detailed spec in `specs/`
- `/build <spec>` → Implement (parallel capable)
- `/review` → Risk-tiered code review
- `/fix <review>` → Auto-fix issues

### 3. Spawn Sub-Agents for Parallel Work

| Agent | Model | Use For |
|-------|-------|---------|
| build-agent | Sonnet | File implementation |
| scout-agent | Haiku | Read-only investigation |
| reviewer-agent | Sonnet | Code review |

Agent definitions: `.claude/agents/*.md`

### 4. Update Expertise After Implementation

If you discover new patterns, update the relevant `expertise.yaml`:
- Add new patterns with examples
- Document anti-patterns to avoid
- Increment usage_count and update last_updated

### 5. Use Output Directories

- `specs/` - Implementation plans
- `reviews/` - Code review reports
- `fix-reports/` - Fix reports
- `build-reports/` - Build reports

## Project Structure

```
{{ project_name }}/
{% for item in structure %}
{{ item }}
{% endfor %}
```

## Technology Stack

{% for tech in tech_stack %}
- **{{ tech.name }}**: {{ tech.description }}
{% endfor %}

## Key Files

{% for file in key_files %}
- `{{ file.path }}` - {{ file.description }}
{% endfor %}

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow patterns in `.claude/commands/experts/{domain}/expertise.yaml`
- Avoid anti-patterns documented in expertise files
- Keep code consistent with existing patterns

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Run existing tests before committing
- Use browser verification for UI changes

### Git Workflow
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Use feature branches for parallel work
- Review changes before merging

## 📝 Recent Sessions

### Session 4 (2026-01-05) - Epic 92 WorktreeManager Core Implementation
**Completed:** Tasks #876-880 from Epic #92 (5/9 tasks, 56%)
**Key Changes:**
- Task 876: WorktreeManager core class with initialization and state tracking
- Task 877: Async git command execution with timeout handling and error classes
- Task 878: Worktree creation with Windows-safe branch sanitization
- Task 879: Worktree merge flow with conflict detection and automatic abort
- Task 880: Worktree cleanup with safe branch deletion
**Features Implemented:**
- WorktreeInfo dataclass for tracking worktree lifecycle
- GitCommandError and WorktreeConflictError custom exceptions
- Branch name sanitization (Windows reserved names, invalid chars, length limits)
- Worktree reuse for existing epics (validates and recreates if stale)
- Automatic uncommitted changes handling before merge
- Support for both regular and squash merges
- Conflict detection using git merge-tree (with fallback)
- Safe branch deletion (only if fully merged)
- Database integration for state persistence
- Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Session 3 (2026-01-05) - Epic 91 Dependency Resolution System Complete
**Completed:** Epic #91 - All 7 tasks (100%)
**Key Changes:**
- Implemented DependencyResolver with Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting
  - Handles hard/soft dependencies, circular detection, priority ordering
  - Comprehensive test suite (7 tests, all passing)
- Added dependency visualization (to_mermaid(), to_ascii(), get_critical_path())
  - Mermaid flowcharts, ASCII diagrams, critical path analysis
  - Epic and batch filtering support
- Updated Session 0 prompts with dependency declaration instructions
  - Common patterns documented (schema→API→UI)
  - Examples with explicit depends_on usage
- Created dependency parsing module with inference heuristics
  - Keyword detection (requires, depends on, after, uses, needs)
  - Self-reference exclusion, validation
- Updated MCP tools for dependency support
  - create_task and expand_epic accept depends_on/dependency_type
  - Validation of dependency references
  - Storage in PostgreSQL metadata JSONB field
- Added MCP dependency graph tools (get_dependency_graph, get_parallel_batches, validate_dependencies)
- Created FastAPI dependency endpoints (5 routes for graph, batches, critical path, validation)
**Git Commits:** 86ab59b, 9506e10, 2e367ed, b9937b4, 4b60d99

### Session 2 (2026-01-05) - Epic 90 Foundation Infrastructure Complete
**Completed:** Epic #90 - All 13 tasks (100%)
**Key Changes:**
- Created complete database schema for parallel execution (parallel_batches, worktrees, agent_costs, expertise_files/updates)
- Added dependency tracking to tasks and epics tables (depends_on, dependency_type columns)
- Created 3 database views (v_project_costs, v_parallel_progress, v_worktree_status)
- Implemented full database abstraction layer (5 new operation sets: batches, worktrees, costs, expertise, dependencies)
- Added configuration schema (ParallelConfig, LearningConfig, CostConfig with validation)
- Created core/parallel module structure (DependencyResolver, WorktreeManager, ParallelExecutor stubs)
- Created core/learning module structure (ExpertiseManager, ModelSelector stubs)
- **CRITICAL:** Implemented MCP transaction utilities with row-level locking for parallel safety
  - withTransaction() wrapper for atomic operations
  - updateTaskStatusSafe() with FOR UPDATE NOWAIT locking
  - checkEpicCompletionSafe() for atomic epic completion
  - Retry logic for lock contention (prevents data corruption)
**Git Commits:** b6f6a3b, 140447c

### Session 1 (2026-01-04) - Epic 89 Core Refinements Complete
**Completed:** Epic #89 - All 5 tasks (100%)
**Key Changes:**
- Enhanced .gitignore templates in initializer prompts (comprehensive coverage)
- Added init.sh .gitignore verification guard
- Implemented post-session repository validation system
- Created external repository export guide
- Added pre-commit .gitignore verification checklist
**Git Commits:** f38a769, 8518043, 226b3d8, 7669c86, 33c0d9d

## Critical Implementation Notes

### CRITICAL: MCP Transaction Safety
- **Task 868 complete:** Transaction utilities implemented
- All parallel agents MUST use `updateTaskStatusSafe()` instead of `updateTaskStatus()`
- Row-level locking with FOR UPDATE prevents race conditions
- Retry logic handles lock contention automatically
- Epic completion checks are atomic within transactions

### Dependencies Between Epics
- ✅ Epic 90 (Foundation) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Epic 91 (Dependencies) - **COMPLETE** - Now unblocks Epic 93
- Epic 92 (Worktrees) blocks Epic 93 (Parallel Executor)
- Epic 93 (Parallel) blocks Epic 94 (Self-Learning), Epic 95 (Cost), Epic 96 (UI)
- All implementation epics block Epic 97 (Testing)

### Architecture Decisions Made
- Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting (proven, efficient)
- One worktree per epic (not per task) to reduce git overhead
- Max 1000 lines per expertise file to prevent token bloat
- Semaphore-based concurrency control (simple, effective)
- Transaction-based safety for parallel updates

### Windows Compatibility
- Branch name sanitization handles reserved names (CON, PRN, etc.)
- Path length limited to 200 chars
- Invalid characters removed from branch names

## Estimated Complexity

## Recommendations

1. ✅ ~~Start with Epic 89~~ - Complete
2. ✅ ~~Complete Epic 90 Foundation~~ - Complete
3. ✅ ~~Epic 91 - Dependency Resolution~~ - Complete
4. **Next: Epic 92 - Implement WorktreeManager for git isolation**
5. **Then: Epic 93 - ParallelExecutor to orchestrate concurrent agents**
6. **Keep parallel mode opt-in initially** - Ensure stability before default
